          <p class="muted">The fastest way to memorise is to practise a few times until you can say it, then hide the word and say it a couple more times.</p> 
          <p class="muted">Then come back again an hour later and try and remember before showing the Thai. 
            The act of trying to remember tells the brain to remember and it will, after just a few days! Don't worry if you can't yet, just keep trying for at least 3s on each word every day in a row.</p>
          <p class="muted">The secret is to do it every day, and TRY to remember for at least 3s.</p>
          <p class="muted">14 words = 2mins per day!</p>
